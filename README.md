**OVERVIEW**

This software is designed to train a virtual simulation of "Katrina", an
Arduino-based project that I designed over the past 3 and a half years (at the
time of writing). It's purpose is to train a neural network to navigate random
obstacles, with the idea that the output network values can be loaded into
Katrina's software.


**LICENSING INFO**

As evident in the LICENSE text file, this software can be used under the MIT
license. In summary, this means you are welcome to use, edit or even sell my
software as long as you include the license and copyright notice along side.
It also states that I'm not liable for any issues that may arise from using
my software. This software is part of a project of mine and is not
recommended for any type of commercial application.

**INFORMATION**

Source code files are located in `src/`. These files are not necessary for any
of the executables to run, however they are there to be edited and recompiled.
Binary files, including precompiled executables, are located in `bin/` - the
files should be kept in this folder otherwise the executables may not run. The
.dll files are additional binary files that the executables need to function,
known as dynamically linked libraries. If you already have these .dll files
elsewhere on your machine, those files can be deleted, although this is not
recommended.
