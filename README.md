OVERVIEW
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This software is used to train a virtual simulation of "Katrina", an
Arduino-based project that I designed over the past 3 and a half years (at the
time of writing). It's purpose is to train a neural network to navigate random
obstacles, with the idea that the output network values can be loaded into
Katrina's software.
